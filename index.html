            <p>Powerful and reliable, the AK-47 is one of the most popular assault rifles in the world. It is most
                deadly in short, controlled bursts of fire. It has been painted using a carbon fiber hydrographic and a
                dry-transfer decal of a red pinstripe. Never be afraid to push it to the limit</p>

            </div>
            <p>As expensive as it is powerful, the Desert Eagle is an iconic pistol that is difficult to master but
                surprisingly accurate at long range. It has been painted using a spider web-patterned hydrographic over
                a red base coat and finished with a semi-gloss topcoat. Be careful where you walk, you never know where
                the web is spread</p>

            </div>
            <p>The Nova's rock-bottom price tag makes it a great ambush weapon for a cash-strapped team. It has been
                airbrushed by hand with a cherry blossom motif, then given a high-gloss top coat.</p>

            </div>
            <p>With a smaller magazine than its unmuffled counterpart, the silenced M4A1 provides quieter shots with
                less recoil and better accuracy. It has been painted using a jungle tiger hydrographic.</p>

            <p>This full-tang sawback Bowie knife is designed for heavy use in brutal survival situations. It has been
                painted using a spider web-patterned hydrographic over a red base coat and finished with a semi-gloss
